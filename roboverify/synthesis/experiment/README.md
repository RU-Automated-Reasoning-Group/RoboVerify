# Maintained experiments and diagnostics

This package contains runners needed for current research results and reusable
diagnostics. Temporary investigation scripts belong outside the repository;
historical reproducibility alone is not a reason to retain a runner.

## Current tools

| Tools | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mcmc/`, `config.py` | Instrumented MCMC search, checked against the shared search implementation. |
| `run_logger.py`, `report.py` | Logging used by the main pipeline and bounded inspection of run artifacts. |
| `invariant_learning/` | Fixed-program counterexample learning; see its [guide](invariant_learning/README.md). |
| `ablate_higher.py`, `motion_premise_ablation.py` | Current vocabulary and motion-premise ablations; see the [verification guide](../cfg/VERIFICATION.md#higher-removal-ablation). |
| `compare_stack_heights.py` | Inspect predicate discrepancies in saved traces; see the [height comparison guide](../inference_lib/README.md#higher-height-tolerance). |

Tests here cover these maintained tools. Environment regressions live in
`synthesis/environment/test_*.py`; collection, replay and task-program
regressions live in `synthesis/cfg/test_*.py`.

Routine demonstrations use `synthesis.entry.collect_demos --task TASK`, with a
provided groundtruth for Stack, Unstack, Reverse, Restack, Grid and Pyramid.
`synthesis.entry.audit_demos` checks saved archives, replays their actions and
checks final physical success after settling. See the
[105-demonstration audit](../inference_lib/README.md#cross-environment-audit)
and [pipeline support matrix](../../../README.md#project-status).
Execution and collection support do not imply synthesis or formal verification.

## Retired investigations

The old controller comparisons, tolerance sweeps, drift diagnosis, path-video
renderer, workspace interventions, manual ID-first continuation and local finite
Unstack proof adapter have been removed, together with their diagnostic-only
tests. The Unstack compatibility wrapper is also gone; use the shared collector
and production factory directly. No alternate demonstration runner remains here.

The [controller findings](CONTROLLER-PATHS.md) and
[workspace and placement findings](TOWER-WORKSPACE.md) retain the rationale for
current settings and the deferred payload-aware placement idea. Historical
reports and videos remain evidence, not current reproduction requirements.
The current controllers and motion contracts are unchanged.

PartialStack and the incorrect historical Reverse verifier remain removed.
Use Restack for that task and the shared Reverse collector for reversal demos;
neither has integrated formal verification support yet.

## Rechecking a collection

From `roboverify/`, with the simulator variables in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md):

```bash
uv run python -m synthesis.entry.collect_demos --task stack --num-blocks 4 --num-trajectories 15
uv run python -m synthesis.entry.audit_demos \
  --demos demos/pipeline-audit-20261023/stack/demonstrations.npz \
  --output demos/pipeline-audit-20261023/stack/audit.json
```

Use the archive path actually printed by collection when collecting a new batch.
Audit defaults to the exact seed set 0–14; pass `--seeds` for another set. Run
every Unstack collection/audit invocation under `timeout --signal=TERM
--kill-after=2s 55s`, using smaller batches if rendering would exhaust the budget.
An incomplete or timed-out invocation is not a passing result.
